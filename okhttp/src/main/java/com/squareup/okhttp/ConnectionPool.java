/**
 * Manages open HTTP and SPDY connections. Requests that share the same {@link Address} may share a
 * connection. This class implements the policy of which idle connections to keep open for future
 * use.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getDefault() system-wide default} uses system properties for tuning parameters:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code http.keepAlive} true if HTTP and SPDY connections should be reused at all. Default
 *         is true.
 *     <li>{@code http.maxConnections} maximum number of idle connections to each to keep in the
 *         pool. Default is 5.
 *     <li>{@code http.keepAliveDuration} Time in milliseconds to keep the connection alive in the
 *         pool before closing it. Default is 5 minutes.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The default instance <i>doesn't</i> adjust its configuration as system properties are changed.
 * This assumes that the applications that set these parameters do so before making HTTP
 * connections, and that this class is initialized lazily.
